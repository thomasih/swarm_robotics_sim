Repository for the simulation scripts used to investigate the inspection strategies of swarm robots for infrastructure inspection.

The specific application that my project is focused on is the inspection of water distribution systems / pipe networks. 

Inspired by biological systems and the challenges of scaling up swarm robotics, I explore algorithms and methods for efficient coordination and operational resilience.
